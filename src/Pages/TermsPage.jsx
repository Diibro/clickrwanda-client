          <h4>Liability</h4>
          <p>Clickrwanda does not act as a supplier as contemplated in the consumer protection act, or otherwise, and is not the party marketing the goods/services. Clickrwanda only provides the platform.</p>
          <p>As explained above, we do not actively monitor data or content. We are not involved in the actual transactions between users. Clickrwanda does not operate as a payment intermediary, payment processor, payment facilitator, money transmitter, money services business, or any type of business akin thereto for the purposes of, or in connection with, any transaction on the site. Clickrwanda also does not fulfil any of the functions (whether as a whole or in part), of a payment intermediary, payment processor, payment facilitator, money transmitter, money services business, or any type of business akin thereto, whether in a direct or indirect manner.</p>
          <p>As most of the content on clickrwanda comes from other users, we do not guarantee or give any warranty or make any representation as to the accuracy and content of postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what is offered, or with regard to the legal capacity of the users that may conduct or complete any transaction. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do.</p>
          <p>In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, including without limitation any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law.</p>
          <p>Clickrwanda may promote, endorse and/or contain links to third party sites and/or services and/or goods. These sites, services and and/or goods are beyond the control of clickrwanda. Clickrwanda is not involved in transactions between users and the operators of such third-party sites. Clickrwanda does not accept responsibility for their content, services and/or products.</p>
          <p>We cannot guarantee continuous, error-free or secure access to our services or that defects in the service will be corrected.</p>

We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit), goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of clickrwanda, even if you advise us or we could reasonably foresee the possibility of any such damage occurring. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply </p>
          <p>Nothing in these terms shall limit our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees.</p>
          <h4>Personal Information</h4>
          <p>By using Clickrwanda, you agree that you are giving your voluntary and informed consent to the collection, transfer, storage and use of your personal information by Clickrwanda on servers located in different locations, and for such purposes, as further described in our Privacy Policy. You also agree that you are giving your voluntary and informed consent to receive marketing communications from us unless you tell us that you prefer not to receive such communications.</p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>In order to ensure the security and reliable operation of the site for all users, Clickrwanda reserves the right at its discretion to take whatever action it finds necessary to preserve the security, integrity and reliability of its network and back-office applications. Any user who commits any of the offences shall, notwithstanding criminal prosecution, be liable for all resulting liability, loss or damages suffered and/or incurred by Clickrwanda and its affiliates, agents and/or partners.</p>
          <h4>Resolution of disputes</h4>
          <p>If a dispute arises between you and Clickrwanda, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.</p>
